# _Homicide Detective_

## A game about a homicide detective in the 1980s

_"When two objects meet, some evidence of that meeting can later be found and verified."_

Homicide Detective is a text-based game where you are a detective who investigates homicides. These homicides are generated from the ranges given in the .json files.

Good luck, stay sexy, and don't get murdered.

### How it works:

All types of objects, murders, people, relationships, so forth are defined in the .json filed in their respective folders.

_Gazing too closely upon the .json files may spoil some of the fun of the game_

scenes - a scene is a place where something happened, or a place where you can go to talk to witnesses or other persons of interest. Scenes contain items and connect to other scenes.

persons - A person requires certain tissues to be functional and a certain amount of bodily fluids to keep from dying. They must also be kept at a decent temperature, or they can die from exposure.

conversations - defines the things that people can say and tells that might indicate that someone is lying. Every spoken statement should be accompanied by one or more facial expressions and speech affectations.

items - the types of items in the game, from furniture and murder weapons to signs of struggle and blood spatter
